# Corona Virus API

Open Data have a [data source](https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/json/) 
which can be flaky at times with the format of the json it returns so this 
services serves mainly as a cleanup service for that data enriching the data
a bit as well with some extra information making it easier to use in tools
like [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).

## Projects

If you use this data source and want to share your site from here in the 
repository feel free to do a PR with the link to your app.
